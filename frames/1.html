        <p>It wasn't until 2002 that Matt Roberts got his first Nintendo 64. </p>
        <p>Growing up as an only child, Matt was generally rather introverted, and his parents had easily convinced him that video </p>
        <p>games weren't a huge priority in his life. </p>

        <p>Despite not having video games, though, Matt managed to keep himself entertained. As a kid, he enjoyed playing simple puzzle </p>
        <p>games of all sorts. Matt played crosswords and mazes and matching games and more.</p>
        <p>Even when Matt finally got his Nintendo 64, he found that he had an odd addiction to The New Tetris 64, a game his parents had </p>
        <p>found for sale at the flea market for only $2.</p>

        <p>In elementary school, Matt had a few close friends, but he had trouble connecting with many of the other kids because his </p>
        <p>hobbies were a bit offbeat; not too many of his classmates enjoyed blazing through puzzle books the way he did. </p>
        <p>He had mixed feelings about school itself, though. Matt felt that class was often bland. </p>
