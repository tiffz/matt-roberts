        <p abbr="carter.png">Hello, students, I'm Mr. Carter, and I'll be your English 1 teacher for this semester. </p>

        <p abbr="carter.png">I understand for most of you here, this class is your first high school English class. </p>

        <p abbr="carter.png">I also understand that many students these days believe that high school English class is pointless and don't understand</p>

        <p abbr="carter.png"> why they should have to read "Romeo and Juliet" or whatever. I'm here to teach you that English class extends beyond </p>

         <p abbr="carter.png">Shakespeare, and that, really, English is about you, your life, your thoughts, and your reflections. </p>

        <p abbr="carter.png">That's why for your first essay in this class, I want you guys to write about one form of media--video games, comicbooks, </p>

        <p abbr="carter.png">movies, songs, or whatever--that you think has made a positive impact on your life. 
        </p>

        <p abbr="carter.png">Make it about 3-5 pages and elaborate on why you think this form of media is significant to you and other people. 
        </p>

        <p abbr="carter.png">Does anyone have any questions about the first assignment? 
        </p>

        <p>...</p>

        <p abbr="carter.png">Alright then, I guess I'll talk about the syllabus. You guys have probably already heard ever since elementary school </p>
        <p abbr="carter.png">
        that plagiarism is bad. To reflect that, your syllabus clearly states that if you plagiarize on an assignment, you receive </p>
        <p abbr="carter.png">an automatic zero. However, since I expect few of you to encounter problems with plagiarism, I'll move on to the </p>
        <p abbr="carter.png">other parts of the syllabus. As you can see, projects and papers count for 40% of your grade while quizzes count for </p>
        <p abbr="carter.png">20% of your grade. The remaining 40% of your grade is made...
