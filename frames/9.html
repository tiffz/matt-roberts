        <p>But when we started talking, I realized I had never connected with anyone before quite like I did with her. </p>
        <p>The early days were fun... We went on little adventures around campus. </p>
        <p>I once skipped class to hang out with her, but she wasn't happy about that. </p>
        <p>We were poor college students, but we found our way of making life fun. </p>
        <p>Beneath those adventures, though, I sort of lived with doubts about my life. </p>

        <p>Looking back, I remember that I started to like school a bit more by the time I was out of high school. </p>
        <p>Mostly, I became more socially well-adjusted, and when I took AP classes, the assignments started to become more interesting. </p>
        <p>In the end, I managed to at least graduate in the top 10% of my class. </p>
        <p>Because I did puzzles in class all the time, some of my classmates got the impression that I was really smart. </p>
        <p>Was I though? <br />I wasn't sure. I mean...</p>
        <p>I enjoyed thinking, but how smart can someone who had no inkling of an idea what they wanted to do with their life really be? </p>

        It's funny how back then everything seemed so confusing. 
        </p>
        <p>
        I knew a few things about myself: I like solving puzzles, I'm a bit of a homebody, and I lean in the introverted direction.

        All those career counselors and surveys told me that I just needed to figure out my personality or whatever to find a job that fit me.
        </p>
        <p>
        But how in the world can I take this vague image I have of who I am and find a career I'll like out of that? 
        </p>
        <p>
            The whole process of figuring out what I wanted to do with my life felt like a giant puzzle. 
        </p>
        <p>
            But in the end, I was missing pieces. I mean, I took a personality test that told me I was an INTJ... 
        </p>
        <p>
            How was I supposed to take those four characters and figure out what I wanted to do with my life?

            Things started to come together towards the end of college though.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I took my first programming class, I found that I really enjoyed the logic of writing programs, and...
        </p>
        <p>
        Well, I decided to learn a bit more about programming on my own and eventually did freelance work when I was a bit tight on money.
        </p>
        <p>
        There wasn't a single moment when I thought, "Hey, I know what to do with my life now!"
        </p>
        <p>
        But when I realized that software engineering was both a fun and lucrative way to make a living, it started to seem </p>
        <p>
        obvious what I wanted to do with my life.
        </p>
        <p>
        In the end, like a puzzle, once I had found out the answer, it was silly to think I ever had trouble coming up with a solution. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Yes.

        Everything seemed to make sense in hindsight. 
        </p>
        <p>
        All those days I spent as a kid solving puzzles... Perhaps I was born to be a problem solver. Perhaps I grew to be one. 
        </p>
        <p>
        I'll leave that problem for the scientists. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Programming involves thinking outside the box, piecing things together to create solutions, and discerning important </p>
        <p>information amidst complexity. 
        </p>
        <p>
        The field suited my enjoyment of sitting in isolation and focusing on problems for long spans of time.

        Sarah sort of liked the idea of me being a programmer. I made decent money and jobs were varied and flexible

        <p>
        enough to accomodate most any lifestyle we wanted.

        After college, our adventures had become scarcer, our dates less frequent, and our passion subdued...

        ...But she was still my best friend.

        ...And I always tried explaining things to her when I got to a particularly tricky problem.
